## Overview

LOLCODE is an esoteric programming language inspired by the lolspeak of lolcats memes. It's designed to be amusing and accessible while being fully functional. Perfect for demonstrating that Web3 development can be fun!

## Features

- ✅ Based on lolspeak/Internet memes
- ✅ Human-readable and entertaining
- ✅ Variables and functions
- ✅ Control flow (loops, conditionals)
- ✅ I/O operations
- ✅ Actually Turing-complete!

## Syntax Highlights

### Basic Commands

```lolcode
HAI 1.2                    BTW Start program (version 1.2)
VISIBLE "Hello Web3"       BTW Print output
I HAS A var ITZ 42         BTW Declare variable
KTHXBYE                    BTW End program
```

### Variables

```lolcode
I HAS A balance ITZ 100           BTW Declare with value
I HAS A wallet                    BTW Declare without value
wallet R "0x123..."               BTW Assign value
balance R SUM OF balance AN 50    BTW Arithmetic
```

### Control Flow

```lolcode
O RLY?                    BTW If statement
  YA RLY                  BTW Then
    VISIBLE "Yes!"
  NO WAI                  BTW Else
    VISIBLE "No!"
OIC                       BTW End if

IM IN YR loop             BTW Loop
  BTW Loop body
IM OUTTA YR loop          BTW End loop
```

### Arithmetic

```lolcode
SUM OF a AN b             BTW Addition
DIFF OF a AN b            BTW Subtraction
PRODUKT OF a AN b         BTW Multiplication
QUOSHUNT OF a AN b        BTW Division
MOD OF a AN b             BTW Modulo
BIGGR OF a AN b           BTW Maximum
SMALLR OF a AN b          BTW Minimum
```

### Comparison

```lolcode
BOTH SAEM a AN b          BTW Equal
DIFFRINT a AN b           BTW Not equal
BIGGR OF a AN b           BTW Greater than
SMALLR OF a AN b          BTW Less than
```

## Examples

### web3_wallet.lol
A Web3 wallet balance checker written in LOLCODE, demonstrating variables, arithmetic, and output.

### ethereum_rpc.lol
Simulates Ethereum RPC calls with LOLCODE, showing control flow and functions.

### gas_calculator.lol
Calculate gas costs for transactions in the most entertaining way possible!

## Usage

### Using lci (LOLCODE Interpreter)

```bash
# Install lci
git clone https://github.com/justinmeza/lci.git
cd lci
make
sudo make install

# Run LOLCODE programs
lci web3_wallet.lol
lci ethereum_rpc.lol
lci gas_calculator.lol
```

## Web3 Concepts in LOLCODE

This implementation demonstrates:

1. **Wallet Management**: Variables represent wallet addresses and balances
2. **Transaction Logic**: Arithmetic for gas and value calculations
3. **RPC Simulation**: Functions simulate blockchain queries
4. **State Management**: Variables track blockchain state
5. **Control Flow**: Conditional logic for transaction validation

## Why LOLCODE for Web3?

### Educational Benefits

- **Accessibility**: Readable syntax lowers barriers to entry
- **Engagement**: Fun language makes learning enjoyable
- **Concepts**: Same programming concepts, different syntax
- **Creativity**: Demonstrates programming flexibility

### Real Lessons

- All languages compile to the same machine operations
- Syntax is just sugar - logic matters
- Web3 concepts transcend specific languages
- Programming can be fun AND educational

## Language Features

### Types

- **YARN**: String
- **NUMBR**: Integer
- **NUMBAR**: Float
- **TROOF**: Boolean (WIN/FAIL)
- **NOOB**: Untyped/null

### Keywords

- `HAI` - Start program
- `KTHXBYE` - End program
- `BTW` - Comment
- `OBTW`/`TLDR` - Multi-line comment
- `I HAS A` - Variable declaration
- `R` - Assignment
- `VISIBLE` - Print output
- `GIMMEH` - Input
- `O RLY?` - If statement
- `YA RLY` - Then
- `NO WAI` - Else
- `OIC` - End if
- `IM IN YR` - Loop start
- `IM OUTTA YR` - Loop end

## Fun Examples

### Hello World (LOLCODE Style)

```lolcode
HAI 1.2
VISIBLE "OH HAI WORLD!"
KTHXBYE
```

### Ethereum Balance

```lolcode
HAI 1.2
I HAS A balance ITZ 1000000000000000000
VISIBLE "WOW! U HAZ " balance " WEI!"
balance R QUOSHUNT OF balance AN 1000000000000000000
VISIBLE "DAT IZ " balance " ETH!"
KTHXBYE
```
