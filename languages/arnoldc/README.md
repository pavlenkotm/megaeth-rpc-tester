## Overview

ArnoldC is an esoteric programming language where all keywords are quotes from Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. It's imperative, procedural, and Turing-complete - just like Arnold's action scenes!

## Features

- ✅ All keywords are Arnold movie quotes
- ✅ Imperative and procedural
- ✅ Variables and functions
- ✅ Control flow structures
- ✅ Turing-complete
- ✅ Maximum entertainment value

## Syntax - Arnold Style

### Program Structure

```arnoldc
IT'S SHOWTIME              # Main method start (like "public static void main")
YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED   # Main method end
```

### Variables

```arnoldc
HEY CHRISTMAS TREE balance           # Declare variable
YOU SET US UP 1000                   # Initialize to 1000
GET TO THE CHOPPER balance           # Modify variable
HERE IS MY INVITATION 500            # Load value
GET UP 200                           # Add 200
ENOUGH TALK                          # Store result
```

### Output

```arnoldc
TALK TO THE HAND "Hello Web3"        # Print to stdout
TALK TO THE HAND balance             # Print variable
```

### Arithmetic Operations

```arnoldc
GET UP x              # Add x
GET DOWN x            # Subtract x
YOU'RE FIRED x        # Multiply by x
HE HAD TO SPLIT x     # Divide by x
I LET HIM GO x        # Modulo x
```

### Comparisons

```arnoldc
LET OFF SOME STEAM BENNET    # Greater than
CONSIDER THAT A DIVORCE      # Equal to
YOU ARE NOT YOU YOU ARE ME   # Logical OR
KNOCK KNOCK                  # Logical AND
```

### Control Flow

```arnoldc
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO SAY PLEASE     # If statement
BULLSHIT                            # Else
YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FOR LOGIC       # End if

STICK AROUND condition              # While loop
CHILL                               # End while
```

### Functions

```arnoldc
LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY functionName    # Function declaration
I NEED YOUR CLOTHES YOUR BOOTS AND YOUR MOTORCYCLE  # Return statement
HASTA LA VISTA, BABY                        # End function
```

## Examples

### crypto_wallet.arnoldc
A Web3 wallet manager that handles balances and transactions in pure Arnold style.
